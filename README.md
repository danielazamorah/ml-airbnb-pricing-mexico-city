# Machine Learning Airbnb Pricing in Mexico City! 

Project where we create and deploy a TensorFlow Machine Learning model for pricing recommendations on Mexico City's new Airbnb listings!

## Inspiration story

My grandparents remodeled a house and placed it on Airbnb. How did they select the price? They looked at the houses in the area and placed a lower price to be competitive. Not taking into account rooms, amenities, descriptions, types, etc. Now, I went through the process of creating a new listing, and in the end, Airbnb recommends a base price, but they don't give a lot of explanation on the factors that influence that recommendation!

You can only check the map with the nearest listings.

And they mention the following:

> To determine listings that are similar to yours, we consider criteria like location, listing type, rooms, amenities, reviews, ratings, and the listings that guests often view alongside yours.
